# Notes for the template

To display the slides with notes, make sure to have two left most monitors 
be same size and aligned. The impressive can be used:

```shell 
> impressive -g 3840x1080 -t None test.pdf
```
The 3840 is the width of the two monitors in total.

`-t None` is to avoid fanzy transitions between slides.
